# SoK: Distributed Ledger Technology Standardisation

This repository holds two lists:
- WorkingGroups.md - A list of DLT working groups from national and international standards organisations and industry consortiums.
- Publications.md - A list of DLT publications from the listed working groups (standards, technical reports, specifications, etc.).

Note that this overview is only intended to cover high-level publications.
Working groups and publications on low-level (i.e. interface or implementation specific) standardisation are not covered in this overview.
